In college I chose to focus on areas in which I felt I needed to improve. My educational focus on media and writing was extremely valuable, but left me lacking in the structured knowledge I would need to advance in my field of Medical Technology Repair. I knew I would need to go back to school to further my career. Eager to see where the future takes me.",

Prior to NSS, I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Tennessee. I took some time off after graduation to attend seminary but realized that I could pursue that program part-time in addition to working in the software development industry. Joining NSS was intended to help refresh and sharpen my skill set now that I am seeking full-time employment. I love the problem-solving aspects of coding, and to me perhaps the most intriguing problem of that set is how to build big applications. Creating practical programs, wrangling large datasets, and writing code to solve complex problems in the most efficient way possible are just some aspects of computer science which drive my love for software development.",
